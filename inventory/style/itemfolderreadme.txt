LabTracker WebDAV shared folder
------------------------------------------------

Congratulations! You probably just mounted this folder as a network drive on your system!


You can now *easily upload new photos* to the inventory database by simply dragging them into a folder here!

You can also *create new inventory items* by creating a new folder, which may or may not contain images and other files. If you do create a folder, please only use alphanumeric characters and hyphens. Otherwise it won't be imported into the database.

Please *DON'T RENAME FOLDERS* that are already in the database. Use the rename button on the item page in your web browser instead! (Otherwise the database will complain that the known folder has disappeared.)
